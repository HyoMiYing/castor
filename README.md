# CASTOR

CASTOR is a management system for monitoring and manipulating with ovens for carbon fiber parts.

# The problem

We need to remotley turn off/on the oven that is located in the factory.

# Web server

We connect to a web server via VPN. 
There is visible information such as:
- number of connected ovens
- oven's temperature
- timestamp

We can also deactivate specific ovens.
